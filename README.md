gbm-lrd: gradient boosted models, with learning rate decay
----------------------------

Originally written by Greg Ridgeway, added to by various authors, forked later here.

Learning rate decay is, at best, only marginally useful in GBMs. Keeping this version alive in case that is proved wrong.

    install.packages("devtools")

Then install `gbm` from GitHub:

    library(devtools)
    install_github("DexGroves/gbm")
